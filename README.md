# Description

This is an updated version of Rob Oake's venerable LaTeX texMemo class.

# Changes

- to/from/etc. and the logo sit just above the horizontal rule
- uses scrartcl instead of article, but uses all computer roman and disables section numbering

# Usage

- header info is all set in the header.tex file
- body lives in body.tex
- shouldn't have to change anything else unless you want to
